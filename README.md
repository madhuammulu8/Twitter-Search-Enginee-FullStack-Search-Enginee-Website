Our web application consists of a simple search box and two buttons(Lucene, Hadoop). If we click on Lucene search Result It will retrieve Lucene indexed data and when we click on the Hadoop button it will retrieve the Hadoop indexed data and display it in the UI.

Basically, our web interface looks like the above image, we have used angular for the front end including HTML, CSS, typescript, font awesome in the front end part. Using Ngif condition is provided an attribute of the anchor element for the inserted grid template and angular expands into a more explicit version in which the anchor element is contained, using that it will expand the grids and display the top 10 tweets. We are retrieving the location, user name, tweets, 

When we click on the Lucene/Hadoop button it will call the tweet service typescript file. In the tweet services file, we have written an HTTP request and it represents the outgoing request like the URL method, in our case, it represents the localhost 8080 which is the port that is used to run our spring boot application.

## Search Engine Results:
We are getting the results from the spring boot and when we click on the query also we can see the data and that's how we are retrieving the data
